I'm here to prove them wrong!\n\nAt 13, while other kids dreamed of becoming cricketers, I was watching my father leave his corporate job to spend more meaningful time with family alongside creating his own technical stuff in his own style and without any business background. For the next 8 years, I lived through every high and low of his journey - and I was hooked. Not just on the idea of building something from nothing, but on the raw, unfiltered impact entrepreneurship could create.\n\n\u26a1 Here's where it gets paradoxical:\nI'm the guy who loves partying and can dance like nobody's watching, yet chose boardroom strategies over V-Defyn (my dream dance club of IIT Delhi). I have genuine friendships with hundreds of people, yet call myself an introvert. I can talk to anyone for hours but still find no time for building my own social media or instagram.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why? Because I realized early that the best things in life aren't either/or - they're both/and.\nWhen I spent years preparing for IIT JEE, it wasn't just about getting into India's top engineering college. It was about finding my tribe - the dreamers, the builders, the people crazy enough to think they can change the world. I knew that's where I'd find the collaborators who'd help turn wild ideas into reality.\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Fast forward to IIT Delhi:\n\u2192 \ud83d\udccd Year 1: learned Debating, Member of Entrepreneurship Development Cell(eDC), dancing enthusiast, lawn tennis player\n\u2192 \ud83d\udccd Year 2: Best Debate Representative, Corporate Relations Executive at eDC, Started Trend Talks : Harvard Business School (HBS)-Inspired case study discussions,\n\u2192 \ud83d\udccd Year 3: Founded Agentix (IIT Delhi's premier AI Agent community), Co-founded RentBasket\n\n\ud83c\udfe0 RentBasket isn't just another startup! We're solving urban India's biggest pain point - making city living affordable and comfortable for young professionals. Furniture and appliances on rent, because why should a 23-year-old spend lacs for a comfortable living when they'll move cities in 2 years?\n\n\u2b50 My superpower? I genuinely want everyone around me to win. Call it the \"Hardik effect\" (yes, my name literally means \"from the heart\"). I've built my entire philosophy around this: I want to win, but not at the cost of my people losing.\n\ud83c\udf1f The result? I have got a network that doesn't just connect - it collaborates, creates, and conquers together.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e What's next? Building ecosystems that create opportunities for thousands.\n\n\ud83d\udcac If you believe that the best way to change the world is to build something meaningful - feel free to connect.", "positions": [{"company": {"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/105349767/", "name": "RentBasket", "logo": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHPyBf1xhB-WA/company-logo_200_200/B56Zt.leuPG0AI-/0/1767355313732/rentbasket_logo?e=1771459200&v=beta&t=zNu4x3QRMaos29wEjZhhY-ZVki_j5pp5Q3ad-MqrrOI"}, "totalDuration": "2 yrs 5 mos", "employmentType": "Part-time", "positions": [{"title": "Co-Founder & CTO", "timePeriod": {"startDate": {"month": 6, "year": 2025}, "endDate": null}, "totalDuration": "8 mos", "description": "", "insights": ""}, {"title": "Co-Founder", "locationName": "Gurugram, Haryana, India \u00b7 Hybrid", "timePeriod": {"startDate": {"month": 9, "year": 2023}, "endDate": {"month": 5, "year": 2025}}, "totalDuration": "1 yr 9 mos", "description": "", "insights": "Project Management"}]}, {"title": "Coordinator : Head of Communities", "locationName": "", "timePeriod": {"startDate": {"month": 5, "year": 2025}, "endDate": {"month": 10, "year": 2025}}, "totalDuration": "6 mos", "description": "", "insights": "", "company": {"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/43269483/", "name": "DevClub IIT Delhi", "logo": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHoD68KsKxYQA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630630404397?e=1771459200&v=beta&t=7j1nU7c7GiAwXsUnaHL0_MvSRsmzB76TsDtiHaTS9sQ"}}, {"title": "Corporate Relations Executive", "locationName": "", "timePeriod": {"startDate": {"month": 6, "year": 2024}, "endDate": {"month": 6, "year": 2025}}, "totalDuration": "1 yr 1 mo", "description": "Another Step towards my Dream is being a part of eDC.", "insights": "", "company": {"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/352954/", "name": "eDC (Entrepreneurship Development Cell) IIT Delhi", "logo": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHNorgG53cLVA/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1630579003709/edc_iit_delhi_logo?e=1771459200&v=beta&t=HNHccGSBOVouieV3GqXupgC67-eTvBzxkeJGdfmwIBE"}}, {"title": "Debating Representative of Nilgiri Hostel", "locationName": "", "timePeriod": {"startDate": {"month": 6, "year": 2024}, "endDate": {"month": 6, "year": 2025}}, "totalDuration": "1 yr 1 mo", "description": "Another Step towards my Dream: Being a part of DebSoc.
